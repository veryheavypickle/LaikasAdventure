# LaikasAdventure

This was a game programmed for a programming sports day. The game was sadly never fully completed and has never been optimised. For this project I was the lead developer managing a team of three others. In this very rushed code you can see pure, uninterrupted thought.

I also produced a lot of the graphics for the project using google image seach with adobe illustrator to convert the images to our style.

## Future of Laika
With a little bit of love, this project can be finished as the point system was never finished aswell as the fuel system. There are also random files in places I don't think they should be which I am too scared to remove as the game starts.
